# SmartScheduler Email Configuration

## Problem Solved

We identified and resolved an issue with email delivery in both development and production environments. The emails were failing to send despite successful network connection tests and SMTP server accessibility.

### Root Cause
The root cause was incorrect or missing SMTP password credentials. The SMTP service requires proper authentication which was failing with the previous configuration.

### Solution
We fixed the issue by:
1. Setting the correct SMTP password in environment variables
2. Creating comprehensive diagnostic tools to identify and troubleshoot issues
3. Developing detailed documentation for both development and production environments

## Key Files

### Documentation
- `EMAIL-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md`: Complete guide to email configuration and testing
- `PRODUCTION-EMAIL-SETUP.md`: Specific instructions for production environment setup

### Testing & Diagnostic Tools
- `test-email.js`: Basic test for email functionality (uses Ethereal.email)
- `test-real-email.js`: Test sending to actual email addresses
- `server/scripts/testProductionEnvironment.js`: Validates environment variables
- `server/scripts/testProductionRegistration.js`: Tests the complete registration email flow
- `server/scripts/productionEmailDiagnostic.js`: Comprehensive diagnostic tool that tests:
  - Environment variable configuration
  - DNS resolution
  - Network connectivity
  - TLS/SSL connection
  - SMTP authentication
  - Email sending

## Email Configuration Summary

The SmartScheduler application uses direct SMTP for email delivery with the following configuration:

```
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@mysmartscheduler.co
SMTP_HOST=server.pushbutton-hosting.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=noreply@mysmartscheduler.co
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_PASS=Success2025
```

## Testing Verification

We've verified that email functionality is working correctly with:
- Successful tests to Ethereal.email (test email service)
- Successful tests to real email addresses
- Successful SMTP connections and authentication

## Next Steps

To ensure ongoing reliability of the email system:
1. Add the correct environment variables to your production environment
2. Run regular diagnostic tests to catch issues early
3. Implement monitoring for email delivery

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Email Configuration Guide](EMAIL-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md) for complete setup instructions
2. For production deployment, follow the [Production Email Setup](PRODUCTION-EMAIL-SETUP.md) guide
3. Run diagnostic tests after making changes to email-related code
