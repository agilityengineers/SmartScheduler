ntegration Architecture
What Smart-Scheduler.ai Needs to Provide
1. Webhook System (Push Notifications)
When appointments are created, updated, or cancelled in Smart-Scheduler, it should send notifications to this app:

POST https://your-replit-app.com/api/webhooks/smart-scheduler
{
  "event": "appointment.created",  // or "appointment.updated", "appointment.cancelled"
  "appointment": {
    "id": "unique-id",
    "scheduledAt": "2025-02-05T14:00:00Z",
    "duration": 15,  // minutes
    "type": "initial_consultation" | "strategy_session" | "interview",
    "client": {
      "email": "client@example.com",
      "name": "Client Name"
    },
    "host": {
      "email": "advisor@yourcompany.com",
      "name": "Advisor Name",
      "role": "advisor" | "interviewer" | "coach"
    }
  }
}
2. REST API Endpoints (Optional - for pulling data)

GET /api/appointments?startDate=2025-02-01&endDate=2025-02-28
GET /api/appointments/:id
3. Authentication

API Key or OAuth tokens for secure communication
Webhook signature verification (shared secret)
Changes Needed on This Platform
1. New Webhook Endpoint
Create /api/webhooks/smart-scheduler to receive appointment events

2. Unified Appointments Table
Expand the current scheduledInterviews table to:

Support multiple sources (Calendly, Smart-Scheduler.ai, manual)
Add appointment type field (consultation, interview, strategy session)
Track which source the appointment came from
3. Enhanced Calendar View

Filter by appointment source and type
Display 15-minute consultations differently from longer sessions
Show appointments from all team members in one view
Recommended Implementation in Smart-Scheduler.ai
If you're building/modifying Smart-Scheduler.ai, here are the minimum features needed:

Feature	Purpose
Webhook configuration UI	Let users enter callback URLs
Event triggers	Fire webhooks on create/update/cancel
HMAC signature	Secure webhook payloads
Client metadata support	Pass through client identifiers for linking
Appointment type tags	Distinguish 15-min calls from full sessions
