# SMTP Fallback Disabled

As of April 3, 2025, we have disabled the legacy SMTP fallback mechanism due to connectivity issues with the SMTP server. The system now relies exclusively on Google Email for all email delivery.

## Current Email Configuration

- **Primary Email Service**: Google Email (Gmail)
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Disabled (previously used SMTP)
- **From Address**: noreply@mysmartscheduler.co
- **Display Name**: SmartScheduler

## Why We Disabled SMTP Fallback

The legacy SMTP server (server.pushbutton-hosting.com) was experiencing intermittent connectivity issues:
- Connection timeouts when attempting to send emails
- Successful authentication but failures during actual email delivery
- Unpredictable behavior leading to delays in email delivery

## Required Configuration

For the email system to function properly, the following environment variables must be set:

```
GOOGLE_EMAIL=noreply@mysmartscheduler.co
GOOGLE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=[your-google-app-password]
GOOGLE_EMAIL_NAME=SmartScheduler
```

## Testing Email Delivery

You can test the Google Email delivery using the following command:

```
node server/scripts/testGoogleEmailDelivery.js your-email@example.com
```

## Re-enabling SMTP Fallback

If you wish to re-enable the SMTP fallback in the future, you will need to modify the `emailService.ts` file to restore the SMTP delivery functionality. This would involve:

1. Restoring the `initNodemailer()` method to create a proper SMTP transport
2. Re-implementing the SMTP fallback logic in the `sendEmail` method
3. Testing thoroughly to ensure proper fallback behavior

However, we recommend continuing to use Google Email exclusively as it provides better deliverability and reliability.
